In this project, our intended object is to experiment with  β-model for a mixture time-scale model prediction. While we were reading the paper "TD Models: Modeling the world with a Mixture of Time Scales", we started to experiment with TD(λ) models and found it is very interesting. In this assignment, we present the work of using TD(λ) to do policy evaluation for one-step models of wall-following and random walks. We will investigate the performance of TD(λ) and Dyna on  β-model in the next assignment.
